# JAS_1.java - Java DSA and Programming Concepts Practice

This file is a comprehensive Java program that demonstrates a wide range of basic programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms. It is designed for learning and practicing Java, especially for those interested in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Features Demonstrated

- **Looping Constructs**
  - Difference between `while` and `do-while` loops

- **User Input**
  - Reading integers, doubles, characters, and strings from the user

- **Math Operations**
  - Finding the maximum of two numbers using `Math.max`
  - Simple calculator supporting `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (exits on `x` or `X`)

- **String Handling**
  - Extracting specific characters from a string

- **Fibonacci Series**
  - Generating and printing Fibonacci numbers

- **Prime Numbers**
  - Printing all prime numbers up to a user-specified limit

- **Armstrong Number Check**
  - Checking if a number is an Armstrong number

- **Arrays**
  - Reading and printing arrays in various formats
  - Updating array elements
  - Finding the maximum and minimum value in an array
  - Reversing an array
  - Linear search in an array

- **2D Arrays**
  - Reading and printing 2D arrays
  - Searching for an element in a 2D array

- **Array Algorithms**
  - Counting numbers with even number of digits
  - Finding the maximum total wealth among customers (LeetCode-style problem)

- **Binary Search**
  - Standard binary search for sorted arrays
  - Order-agnostic binary search (works for both ascending and descending arrays)

- **Dynamic Arrays**
  - Using `ArrayList` for dynamic array operations

## How to Run

1. **Compile:**
   ```sh
   javac JAS_1.java
   ```

2. **Run:**
   ```sh
   java JAS_1
   ```
