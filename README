## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 [`JAS_1.java`](JAS_1.java)
A multi-functional Java program that demonstrates:

- 🔄 Differences between `while` and `do-while` loops  
- 📥 Taking user input for:
  - ✅ Finding the maximum of two numbers
  - 🔡 Extracting a character from a string
  - 🔢 Generating a Fibonacci series
  - 🧮 Building a simple calculator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)  
  - 🧯 Exit on entering `x` or `X`
  - 🔍 Printing all prime numbers up to a given limit
  - 💠 Checking if a number is an Armstrong number
  - 📦 Reading and printing elements from an integer array
