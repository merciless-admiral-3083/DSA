# Java DSA Practice

This repository contains Java programs for practicing basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, user input handling, and control structures.

## Files

- [JAS_1.java](JAS_1.java):  
  A comprehensive Java program demonstrating:
  - Difference between `while` and `do-while` loops
  - Taking user input for various tasks
  - Finding the maximum of two numbers
  - Extracting a specific character from a string
  - Generating a Fibonacci series
  - A simple calculator supporting `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` operations (exits on `x` or `X`)
  - Printing all prime numbers up to a user-specified limit
  - Checking if a number is an Armstrong number
  - Reading and printing an array of integers

- [Prac.java](Prac.java):  
  A simple Java program to print the Fibonacci series up to a user-specified number of terms.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Java files:**
   ```sh
   javac JAS_1.java Prac.java
   ```

2. **Run a program:**
   ```sh
   java JAS_1
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   java Prac
   ```

## Launch Configurations

The project includes a [VS Code launch configuration](.vscode/launch.json) for debugging and running Java files.
